      <br />Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
      industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
      since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
      scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
      centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
      essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
      desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
      Lorem Ipsum.

      As a <b>consequence</b>, our project was <strong>based off</strong> the
      concept of the “��® system-based framework. Unlike the existing
      application of template functions, we do not have to use the formulae such
      as  ¯¯¯, “¯¯¯¯ and ��¯ as well as the standard framework in Java.” Even
      though the concepts for “�����������® in <b><em>Java</em></b> were
      developed in the late 1960s, they have since continued to provide the same
      basic functions we did with the concepts implemented in previous versions
      of the language.
